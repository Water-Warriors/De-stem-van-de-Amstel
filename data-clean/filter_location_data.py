def filter_points_by_distance(points_gdf, area_gdf, distance_meters=50):
    """
    Selects points that are within a specified distance of an area's geometry.

    This function performs these steps:
    1.  Uses a projected Coordinate Reference System (CRS) suitable for the Netherlands (EPSG:28992)
        to ensure distance calculations are accurate in meters.
    2.  Creates a "buffer" polygon around the area_gdf geometry.
    3.  Selects all points from points_gdf that fall within this buffer zone.
    4.  Returns the filtered points in their original CRS.

    Args:
        points_gdf (GeoDataFrame): The GeoDataFrame of points to be filtered.
        area_gdf (GeoDataFrame): The GeoDataFrame of the area (e.g., a river) to buffer.
        distance_meters (int): The distance in meters for the buffer.

    Returns:
        GeoDataFrame: A new GeoDataFrame containing only the points within the buffer.
