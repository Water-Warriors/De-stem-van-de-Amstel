# Cleaning the data.

Okay so first we clean up the data with the `clean_data.py` script.
After this data is cleaned we can run the `filter_location_data.py` script to filter the data based on the amstel region data.
Then we run the `pfas_food.py` script to calculate the pfas for each food type. 

and after we prepare the data data with the pfa's food data to get a dataset that contains all the pfas with food data.
