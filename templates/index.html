    <h2 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">What are PFAS?</h2>
    <p>
      PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) are a large family of more than
      4,700 man-made chemicals that have been used since the 1950s in industry
      and consumer goods. They are extremely resistant to water, grease, and
      heat. These properties make PFAS valuable in everyday products, but also
      very dangerous to the environment and human health.
    </p>
    <p>
      PFAS are often called <strong>‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù</strong> because they
      hardly break down in nature. Once released into the environment, they can
      contaminate drinking water, accumulate in fish and livestock, and remain
      in the human body for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies suggest links between PFAS exposure and health issues such as
      liver problems, thyroid disease, developmental delays, and even cancer.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why We Compare PFAS to Everyday Foods</h2>
    <p>
      PFAS levels are usually reported in <strong>nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg)</strong>.
      While scientifically accurate, these numbers can feel abstract. To make them easier to understand,
      we compare them to the amount of PFAS you might find in everyday foods:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0;">
      <li>üçé <strong>An apple(100g)</strong> ‚Äì a simple, everyday snack</li>
      <li>üç∫ <strong>A glass of beer(250ml)</strong> ‚Äì a familiar drink</li>
      <li>üçó <strong>A  portion of chicken(200g)</strong> ‚Äì a larger meal you can picture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These comparisons don‚Äôt mean eating an apple or drinking a beer is the same as soil exposure.
      They simply make invisible numbers more relatable.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Where These PFAS Come From</h2>
    <p>
      Each type of PFAS we detect can be linked back to how it has been used in daily life:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0;">
      <li><strong>Use categories</strong> ‚Äì broad sectors such as textiles, packaging, or electronics</li>
      <li><strong>Sub-uses</strong> ‚Äì specific functions like water-repellent coatings or grease resistance</li>
      <li><strong>Applications</strong> ‚Äì the actual products, from non-stick pans to firefighting foams</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By showing both the <strong>food-equivalent comparisons</strong> and the <strong>real-world uses</strong>,
      we highlight two key points:
    </p>
    <ol style="margin: 1rem 0;">
      <li>PFAS exposure is easier to grasp when connected to what we eat and drink.</li>
      <li>PFAS are everywhere because they‚Äôve been used across so many industries.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-top: 1rem;">
      Our goal is to make PFAS data accessible, relatable, and eye-opening ‚Äî so it‚Äôs clear why PFAS matter in our daily lives.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">PFAS in the Netherlands</h2>
      <p>
        In the Netherlands, PFAS contamination has been found in several rivers,
        lakes, and soil sites. These chemicals can spread from industrial
        facilities into the wider environment.
      </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">PFAS near the Amstel in Amsterdam</h3>
        <p>
          Recent environmental monitoring has shown traces of PFAS in surface
          waters such as the <strong>Amstel river</strong>. While the levels are
          being closely studied, it raises concern because the Amstel is not
          only an important waterway for the city but also connects to broader
          ecosystems. Authorities continue to monitor and research safe levels
          of PFAS in this area.

      <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">Where are PFAS found?</h3>
      <ul style="justify-items: center; margin: 0.3rem 0;">
        <li>Non-stick cookware (e.g., Teflon pans)</li>
        <li>Waterproof clothing and outdoor gear</li>
        <li>Food packaging such as fast-food wrappers and pizza boxes</li>
        <li>Firefighting foams used at airports and military bases</li>
        <li>Industrial coatings, paints, and cleaning products</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">Why are PFAS a problem?</h3>
      <p>
        Because PFAS do not naturally degrade, they accumulate over time in
        water, soil, and living organisms. This means that every year, the
        levels of PFAS in our environment can grow unless strict regulations and
        clean-up actions are taken.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">Health Risks</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Research has linked PFAS exposure to:</p>
      <ul style="justify-items: center; margin: 0.3rem 0;">
        <li>Increased cholesterol levels</li>
        <li>Liver and kidney damage</li>
        <li>Weakened immune system (less effective vaccines)</li>
        <li>Thyroid disease</li>
        <li>Pregnancy complications and low birth weight</li>
        <li>Developmental issues in children</li>
        <li>Higher risk of certain cancers (kidney, testicular)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem; text-align: center;">What can you do?</h3>
      <ul style="justify-items: center; margin: 0.3rem 0;">
        <li>Choose PFAS-free cookware such as stainless steel or cast iron</li>
        <li>Avoid water- and stain-repellent products unless PFAS-free</li>
        <li>Check if your drinking water supplier monitors PFAS levels</li>
        <li>Support environmental initiatives that regulate and clean PFAS</li>
      </ul>
